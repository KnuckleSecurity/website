I"¼	<p>It is a small possibility, but not impossible, that you may have encountered
with a broken package after updating your system, while using rolling release
operating system. Packages pushed into the repositories without going under
any superior control. For example, when new version of a package arrives,
manjaro checks it in itâ€™s containers, then push them into public repos. While
it is quite a personal preference which approach is better for you, it is not the
same for each operating system. So if you have a broken package, or you are not just
not comfortable with newer version of the release you may wish to downgrade it. 
In this post you will learn how to downgrade a package and ignore updates.</p>

<p>Download utility called <strong>downgrade</strong> with your favorite package manager.</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yay <span class="nt">-S</span> downgrade
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After installing it run</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>downgrade cmatrix
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It will prompt you to a selection screen between version just like that</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Available packages (community):

   1)  cmatrix    2.0  1  remote
+  2)  cmatrix    2.0  2  remote
+  3)  cmatrix    2.0  2  /var/cache/pacman/pkg

select a package by number: 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Select which version of the program you wish to use than press enter.
After that step, downgrade utility will ask you to whether you wish to
add that program to ignorepackage list to prevent later updates or not.</p>
<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>add cmatrix to IgnorePkg? <span class="o">[</span>y/N]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> in this step, the package wont be affected while doing
system wide updates. However if you wish to change it back and update the
software someday, you need to edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pacman.conf</code>. Go find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IgnorePkg=</code>
variable, and delete the package name there. You can also add other packages 
here manually to disable updates for a spesific program.</p>
