It is essential to have the knowledge on <em>Public Key Cryptography</em> ,<em>Encryption</em> and <em>Digital Signing</em> as the prequisition.</p>

<p><em>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</em> is a generic term that represents every connection that are manage and establish <em>Public Key
Encryption</em>.</p>
<h1 id="why-pki-is-important-">WHY PKI IS IMPORTANT ?</h1>
<p>While public key encryption solves the problem of the dataâ€™s legibility by everyone, PKI adds authentication mechanism on top of it.
Combination of those two mechanism together makes online communication becomes much more trustworthy.</p>
<h1 id="real-life-scenario">REAL LIFE SCENARIO</h1>

<p>Let us examine this example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>John</strong>: Hey Robert, can you send those confidential data to Ashley?</li>
  <li><strong>Robert</strong>: Sure, but who is she?</li>
  <li><strong>John</strong>: She is the HR manager of BBSec.</li>
  <li><strong>Robert</strong>: All right.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />For Robert to send any confidential data to Ashley, he must find Ashleyâ€™s public key. However, searching for her
public key on the web would not be smart since there could be many other public keys for other Ashleys. How can Robert
be confident that he uses the correct public key from the Ashley he wants to communicate?
<br /><br />To solve this problem, what we call <strong>certificates</strong> comes into play.</p>
