I"l	<p>This post will discuss all the terminologies behind <em>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</em>.
It is essential to have the knowledge on <em>Public Key Cryptography</em> ,<em>Encryption</em> and <em>Digital Signing</em> as the prequisition.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-pki">WHAT IS PKI?</h1>
<p><em>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</em> is a system on which every connection that requires to establish and manage <em>Public Key
Encryption</em> depends. This procedure done by what we call <em>x509 certificates</em>.</p>
<h1 id="why-pki-is-important">WHY PKI IS IMPORTANT?</h1>
<p>While public key encryption solves the problem of the data’s legibility by everyone, PKI adds authentication mechanism on top of it.
Combination of those two mechanism together makes online communication becomes much more trustworthy.</p>
<h1 id="real-life-scenario">REAL LIFE SCENARIO</h1>

<p>Let us examine this example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>John</strong>: Hey Robert, can you send those confidential data to Ashley?</li>
  <li><strong>Robert</strong>: Sure, but who is she?</li>
  <li><strong>John</strong>: She is the HR manager of BBSec.</li>
  <li><strong>Robert</strong>: All right.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />For Robert to send any confidential data to Ashley, he must find Ashley’s public key. However, searching for her
public key on the web would not be smart since there could be many other public keys for other Ashleys. How can Robert
be confident that he uses the correct public key from the Ashley he wants to communicate?
<br /><br />To solve this problem, what we call <em>x509 certificates</em> comes into play.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-x509-certificate">WHAT IS A X509 CERTIFICATE?</h1>

<p>An <em>x509 certificate</em> is a digital document that validates the integrity of the association between identities, shuch as websites,
organizations or individuals.
<br />An_x509 certificate essentially contains those:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Person’s name, address, email,etc.</li>
  <li>Person’s public key.</li>
  <li>The <em>Issuer</em> of the certificate.</li>
  <li>The <em>encrypted hash</em> of the certificate.</li>
</ul>

<p>If Robert can find a certificate that binds Ashley’s name with her company BBSec, he can confidently tell that it is the correct
certificate he was looking for.
<br /><br />There are two more fields above which are <em>Issuer</em> and <em>encrypted hash</em>. We will come to that later.</p>
