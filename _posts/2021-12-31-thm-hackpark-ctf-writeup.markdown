# ENUMERATION

Run Network Mapper (**nmap**) on Hackpark machine to discover opened ports and services.   

Full command : 
{% highlight bash %}
nmap -sV -sS -O -T4 -p- {machine IP} -Pn -oN {outputfile}
{% endhighlight %}

| Parameter              | Functionality                                          | 
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|-sV                     | Probe open ports to determine service/version info     |
|-sS                     | SYN, half TCP scan                                     |
|-O                      | Enable OS detection                                    |
|-T4                     | T{0-5} Set scan speed, higher is faster                |
|-p-                     | Scan all 65536 ports                                   |
|-Pn                     | Skip host discovery                                    |
|-oN                     | Write output to a file                                 |

Output of the scan:
{% highlight bash %}

Two ports opened:

## Port 3389 ssl/ms-wbt-server?
Port 3389 is running an [RDP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) service.
However, it is not possible to exploit it since we do not have any information about the version of the service.

## Port 80 http Microsoft IIS httpd 8.5
[**Microsoft IIS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services) web server is running on port 80.

<br><br>Let us quickly check the [robots.txt](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots.txt/) to see if we can find something interesting.

Nothing fancy here. Let us move on.
<br><br>[Dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch) can help us to enumerate subdirectories of the webserver.
Frameworks like **GoBuster** and **DirBuster** are also an option.

The **/admin** directory might be interesting. However, the request to the directory gets redirected to a **.aspx** file 
which is probably a login form.

We will have to launch a [brute-force](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/brute-force-attack) attack in order to
gain access to the backend panel.
<br><br>There is only one blog post published on the main page, and the author of it is the **ADMINISTRATOR**. 
So we can assume that the only user registered to the panel is the adminâ€™s itself.

# EXPLOITATON

## Brute-Forcing the Panel
In order to create continuous HTTP requests, we have to know how the HTTP request looks.
Launch the [**Burp Suite**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-burp-suite/) to examine the HTTP POST request sent 
when a login attempt occurs.
